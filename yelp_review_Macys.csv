This major design flaw kept me away from the Waterfront Macy's for a while, but since figuring it out, I've made some great finds.  My advice is to get a Macy's card, and pay it off every month.  With the Macy's card you get quality coupons mailed & e-mailed regularly that can be used in addition to any sales they have going on.

My bff and I were shopping and I was hoping to find some good deals and maybe do a little Christmas shopping. Not the case...Men's Clothing was way, way more than I was willing to fork out. The sales racks were not even 'sale' prices, really. I was also on the hunt for some new bras. I asked the sales clerk for some assistance. No such luck. Her response was that she was new and couldn't help. Maybe I could go down to the next counter and ask another clerk. Here's the thing with that, there was no one else around. Cricket, cricket. I mean, you couldn't even try to help me? In the end, I did end up purchasing some K-Cups, since they were on sale - buy one, get one free.

I WANT to like Macy's, because it's convenient to be able to buy many different things in one place.  I went there last fall with the primary intention of buying perfume for myself (just another bottle of Clinique Happy).

First, however, I stopped in the men's department to buy my husband some dress shirts.  A sales associate said hello to me, but then watched me riffle through shirts for greater than 20 minutes, as I was trying to find my husband's size, without offering to help.

Next stop was handbag department to get a bag for an interview.  This department actually did please.  The girl working there was extremely helpful and attentive.

Last stop was Clinique counter.  One associate was doing a makeup application.  The other was checking someone out.  Waited awhile, just needed to get my bottle of Happy and go.  Then the ""other"" went over and chatted with another person for awhile, telling me she'd be ""right with me"".  Then went into their employee area to do something else.  I seriously waited more than 10 minutes for someone to help me.  Finally, the associate who had been doing the makeup saw me, asked if she could help me (as she's trying to check out the person she did makeup for), grabbed my perfume, and checked me out right after.

Was looking for women's shoes, specifically kitten heels for a wedding, and there wasn't even one option for me.

My boyfriend was looking for a navy blue suit.  They don't even carry Alfani brand suits, just dress shirts. He found one by Bar III, but it only comes in slim fit, AND they didn't have his size.  

So when I said small selection and not much variety, that's what I meant.  It's good to have this close by, but they could have done a better job and made it bigger.

In all fairness, I understand this a brand new location, and it may take some time to get things right. I'm writing this review in hopes of being heard. I would LOVE to have a Macy's so close that I can actually shop at.

I agree with one of the other reviews about the selection or lack there of. This has to be one of the WORST department stores I have ever visited, as far as selection goes. I'm a pretty conservative woman in my 30's.....the women's apparel that has been selected is just terrible. I feel as though it is TOO conservative. If I was looking for new church clothes or something to wear to a conservative political function, I would shop here. There needs to be more options for women that have professional jobs AND still like to be stylish. Your shoe department is pretty awful as well. Please, please, please give us something we can wear to work that's hip and professional, and something we can wear out for dinner or cocktails.(besides a formal gown)

The staff is SUPER FRIENDLY. I can't tell you how many times they asked if I needed help. I would have loved to have spent money here....the staff is GREAT!! They seemed aware of the selection issues.

First of all, if you want any cute tights, or the fun ones with bling or cute designs...or anything updated and contemporary in terms of tights/hose...don't expect to find any here!! 

Anyways, I found a pair of plain black tights (mashed on the wall with unlike styles and with no sort of organization or merchandising skills applied - per typical Macy's standards I guess).  I found another pair since they were 2/$22 hue deal and I grabbed a pair of black leggings.  

So I turn to see 8 people in line at this one checkout station, then walk across the floor to another checkout station with 10 people waiting.  I'm clearly standing in the middle of the aisle holding product to buy...and the lovely Aspen appears. 

Now, I saw her trying to fly by me without greeting or any type of extension of customer service skills. But I saw the name tag and the portable printer on her hip...I yelled after her ""excuse me? can you ring me up?""  

Oooooh man!!! She looked like I just ran over her foot. 

She literally said to me (first words) ""if you're paying credit. And if you want a bag, go to a register"". 


I wanted to say ""FU$& YOU ASPEN"" but I didn't want to sink to her crap level. 

Instead, I said ""yeah, credit card. I'm fine with that as long as nobody talks to me on my way out...as I'm holding these things in my hands.""  

She didn't say a word.  She started scanning. Asking me to hold this like that. And let her out the sticker there. Um, YOURE WELCOME ASPEN.  She was a total B!! the whole time. Not one, thanks for helping. Or thanks for holding this. Upon printing my receipt, her words were ""here's your receipt"". 

Again, no thank you. Or come again. Or sorry we have such long lines. Or happy holidays. So rude. 
ASPEN, you are terrible. If you hate your job, go do something else.  Or stay home. Be angry at home. Because honey, angry attitudes and retail don't mix.

Tom kept taking phone calls, processing orders over the phone and it felt like he was doing everything he could to avoid the line of ladies that needed assistance with shoes. Michael was nice, scambling to help everyone, however it took him 30 minutes to even call for assistance. He kept saying a manager is on their way, a manager is on their way... It took the manager forever to get there and still only 1 out of the 12 were being helped.

There was some sort of mix up with her getting the ""family/friend discount"" for Wednesday at a cheaper rate, but Michael didn't explain it well enough so she thought she was walking out wih her shoes today. She was about to faint and he was telling her she couldn't have them and she was getting very upset because she had paid for them. As a manager in retail this was an easy, override it and do what's right for the guest, but he wasn't going to. He told her he'd have to see what the manager said. The manager ringing me up didn't even acknowledge the situtation which was very strange and then suddenly another manager walked up and he was finishing saying to the guest ""Well I would need a manager to aprove but if you don't tell other guests then maybe this acception is ok"".

It can get messy at times but really what department store doesn't.  Even the fabulous Fashion Square gets a little messy when you see it packed elbow to elbow with wild women hunting through sizes on a blow out sales day.  I'm a fan for sure.",0,"AZ","Phoenix",80,9,7,0.0875,0.1125

 I didn't really find anything that perked my interest and feel that the selection at this Macy's isn't that great....there were whole sections of clothes I didn't even bother with because they weren't what I would consider even style (majority is just branded bullshit or things a 15year old would wear or old peoples clothing).

I didn't have great customer service last time in the clothing area, but this time received great, polite, and friendly service in the home department. 

One girl was helping me and the BF to check stock of a dutch oven I was considering. They didn't have a lot of the colors out since it was on clearance so she went to go check their warehouse stock and went to find me to let me know that she can order exactly what we want and have it shipped to our home for free. They were so sweet about looking up stuff and kept telling us don't settle if the right color makes us happy. 

I had a question about a sign for 40% off as it was right next to the Kitchen Aid mixers but was very vague so between the girl helping us and her manager they were able to work it out. So glad we asked! I almost didn't as I thought no way would a Kitchen Aid mixer ever go on mega sale and it probably means just the hand mixer sitting on the same table. They applied it to a mixer so I was sold and got the nicer, Architect series. Plus there was a rebate for a free attachment of a glass bowl or meat grinder so I'm getting a $60 grinder too! Then the ladies got us to open up a Macy's card so we saved 10% more off instantly then 20% gets skimmed off our cards balance for purchases made today and tomorrow. 

Oh, and I had a exchange to skim off another $90. 

So a Kitchen Aid mixer, a Martha Stewart 7qt dutch oven and Waterford Marquis crystal glass set and we were out only $150 instead of their $700 value. 

I have a buyers high right now. I am Queen Deals but this definitely one of the best things I've ever gotten on sale. I've waited for years to have a Dutch oven and a Architect and it paid off to wait!

Their clothes are just as cheap as what you would find at Forever 21, but at least Forever 21 charges the appropriate prices for what they sell.  Here, you can buy a cheap, poorly made shirt for 50 bucks.  Or, if you like, you can get a Lucky Brand shirt that Lucky Brand won't sell at their stores and pay 80 bucks for it.  The choice is yours!

Oh, yeah.  My family buys us stuff at Macy's all the time and sometimes I need to return it.

If you're lucky, you can find decent deals on shoes and kitchen stuff.  That's all I've really noticed.

For this Macy's in particular, the clothing areas are always chaotic messes and there is zero customer service.  The shoe department is cleaner, but they get easily overwhelmed as they are short-staffed.  The kitchen section is usually well-put together and easy to navigate and the customer service is the best here out of all the departments.

The changing rooms are filled with crying babies that need their diapers changed and you have to fight with ladies to get a view of a purse you're not going to end up liking anyway.  What a mess.

He didn't even bother to search for it on the computer, he just casually looked through the glass display and after looking through about 3 cases said that he couldn't find it so that meant that they didn't have any left. What the heck!?

I then began to look throughout ALL of the remaining cases looking for the ring since he barely even helped me at all. After looking around aimlessly for a while, I was finally asked again if I needed help. This time when I showed the worker the picture of the ring online she actually went ahead and looked for it on their computer (which they should have done in the first place!) ---I later found out that this woman was a manager when I called the store to complain about my experience.

After she found that they in fact did not have the ring in stock, she turned me over to a different worker. Before she walked away she clearly said to both me and the worker that I would receive free shipping and 25% off. After she walked away I was given the 25% off, but then charged $10 for shipping. I had already wasted a lot of time in the store so I agreed to pay for shipping and requested for it to be sent to my house. I then *clearly* stated that I wanted a size 7 ring.
She charged my card and I left the store, already disappointed in the service I received.

I arrived home about an hour later and checked my email for a confirmation of the purchase they had done for me. Once I opened the email I saw that she had ignored what I told her about being a size 7 and needing the standard ring size. My order was for a ring size 8, which will not fit my finger.

As I waited for her to get out, I noticed that a female employee stared at me and proceeded to walk a good 50ft from behind the register to stand right behind me about 10ft away. I watched as she pretended to clean a rack of clothes. When my girlfriend walked out of the restroom we headed for the 3rd floor and I told her about the incident. She thought it was weird as well.

I felt someone staring at me and noticed that a gentlemen was half way across the area watching our every move like we were stealing our being suspicious. (Note that my girlfriend and I had no bags, purses, or baggy clothing whatsoever.) I told my girlfriend we are being watched again. She got upset but thought I was joking. As we made our way to the escalator, we passed the appliance area. The same gentlemen that was staring at me stood no more than 5ft away from us. We both had nothing in our hands. I looked in the clearance area of the appliances and the employee felt it necessary to walk right next to me, stand and pretend to look or count a display merchandise setup. My girlfriend stood array from me and watch the guy watch me. I felt extremely uncomfortable. I understand trying to prevent theft and being cautious, but I felt their loss prevention staff and employees were going too far. As my girlfriend and I were leaving, she even felt uncomfortable and was irritated at the actions and behaviors these employees were doing. 
Again, being apart of the loss prevention team, I understand how things work and what employees and customers do. But to make my shopping experience that uncomfortable was uncalled for.

enter ""d"" (I think, but you'll recognize him by the fact that he looks like): a native american clark griswold, except six notches more clueless-looking.  Poor guy.  About me: I really don't have much patience for dumb people, no offense.  So when someone has been dealt such a pitiful hand in the intellect category that I actually feel sorry for them despite their idiocy, that person truly has it rough.  Now my wife, on the other hand, she wanted to slit this guy's throat.  I only pity you all for not knowing her well enough to know just how comical and dire that is.

So my shoe blew up in a particularly embarrassing fashion as I was leaving work today.  We went to Macy's because I had a gift card.  Usually the department store men's shoe section is exactly the place you go when you're looking for a rancid smattering of riff-raff and retreads (no offense), and ""d"" fit the bill here with his black levi's and black t-shirt for a work uniform.  so there's a sale and i ask if they have this one shoe size in a 13 (yes, it's *huge*).  clark comes back and says no, they don't, but they do have it in an 8.5 or 9.5.  Great, I'll take a pair for my invisible midget friend here.  Meanwhile, some young michael jackson knockoff comes in and asks ""d"" if he can show him how to tie a tie.  not shitting you.

so i ask ""d"" if they have this other shoe and apparently they have it in a 12.  I ask: ""do those shoes happen to run large at all?""  Him: ""Um. They come in up to a size 13, we just don't have it.""  Right.  I make a sufficiently pained expression and say that i will try on the size 12 just in case.

Before he gets to getting me the size 12 shoe, he starts tying the tie on this waifish, pubescent kid who can only be conflicted in all the most crucial ways, including how high on one's ass pants should be worn.  My wife seethes at this, because he just stopped helping us to work on this other guy.  She wants to leave and go to another Macy's.  I opt to just pick up my next potential purchase and bang the soles together, to her immense consternation.

So she goes on and walks around because she can't handle this guy's impudence.  I decide to walk over to where the blind is leading the blind and leer, just to get my point across.  It ultimately works.  I get my shoes.  That's most of the story.

Except that while I was paying, ""d"" asked if I was thinking of upgrading my wardrobe anytime soon.  Humility, to be sure.

(Wife: ""I was kind of angry.  He just kind of left us there and started helping someone else, like we were nothing.""  As you can see, she is worked up.)",8,"AZ","Scottsdale",173,21,16,0.092485549132948,0.121387283236994

 Note, I've never had an issue with any past orders.  We split the order, as I paid for one piece with my credit card, and the other with cash.  One piece was stated that it was in stock ,and the other would need to be ordered.  I received a call that the orders were ready for delivery about six weeks later.  Because of a move, I ended up I rescheduled the delivery to my new place.  This is where it goes down hill fast on a sled--yikes.  I had a move in scheduled on Saturday to my new place by 9am.  Two days before the delivery I receive information the window is from 815-1015am.

  I called customer service to see if I could be moved down the delivery window, as I would not be able to have access to the new place until 9am.  I was told no I would have to reschedule.  This cost me an additional days rent as I did not want to reschedule.  So Saturday morning arrives.  The delivery men were friendly, and told me I needed to take a look at the items.

  Multiple issues--one piece was a different color than the other.  The item that was the correct color had been damaged in shipping and also had a factory defect in it.  So the delivery men told me that Macys would call me.  Me thinks not- as this delivery experience was leaving a terrible taste in my mouth.  I showed up at the store next day asking for a department manager.  I then had a useless associate say she could try to help, and then when I described what had taken place she stated she could not.  I went to another store to look at other pieces, as I figured it could only go further south.  I found something at Z Gallerie and then went back to Macys to talk with the department manager.

  I was told if I wanted a new shipment it would be another 5 weeks, but was not offered any concessions due to their error.  I was also told I would have to wait 2 weeks for my cash refund.  I received a call from the manager that they cancelled the ordered on the 7th and my refund was processing.  I called today the 17th to customer service and was told my check was sent 02/10 from Florida.  Disgusting.  I don't think I will be doing business with Macys furniture again and if I do, it will only be on credit or debit card as my credit card was not charge for merchandise not received.

I am writing this review based on the Men's Wear department. Absolutely amazing. 

Recently, I started a new job, and it was time to get a new wardrobe. I came into some cash, so I figured why not splurge a little.

I bought a suit, some slacks, and a bunch of dress shirts in this round of shopping. The remarkable note here is that the staff is VERY friendly and HELPFUL.

They aren't just cashiers. They know how to properly measure you for your clothing, make recommendations on what looks good, and give you suggestions on what is properly fitted and what isn't.

I nearly bought a jacket that was two sizes too big because it felt ""comfortable"" and it was my old size (thank God I've been working out"". The new jacket size actually is WAY more flattering and I look like a G in it.

Helpful tip: If the sizings work for you, buy as many of the DKNY and Calvin Klein dress shirts as you can because these designers tend to keep changing their cuts.

"HZf4PgSXgGZ0EPGa-cuUPQ","E-MCThlWqZxfJRF9_3Ll4w","2011-08-18",2,"Having spotted a $28 Dior Addict (Stiletto... a word that sounds sexy, yet dangerous... recall Fonda's Single White Female) I really wanted days ago at Sephora, I decided to check out two department store makeup counters to see if they were offering a ""gift w/ purchase.""  (Turned out that the ""gift w/ purchase"" promotion will not be offered till September.)  Macy's turned out to be my first and my last stop that day due to time constraints, the way I was treated, and the fact that the Macy's rep behind the Dior counter quoted me a lower price for the lipsticks I wanted to purchase- I was going to buy at least two ( Stiletto and Envy), and I also started looking into the $30 Rouge Dior colors and the $34 Serum Rouge selections.  Since I am not fond of returning tainted lipsticks, I proceeded to sample some of the testers using the disposable brushes they have for customers to use.  It wasn't long before a woman permanently parked herself behind and to the right of me where I could see her. Even though I greeted her a nice hello and continued to sample colors, after awhile, I felt so uncomfortable, that I decided I'd just stick to the two choices I initially made, since I can always come back if I ended up liking the products.  

The original rep rang my purchases up, and the total was higher than I estimated it to be.  I asked her why, and she said that she'd looked at another product's tag when I had asked her earlier for the price.  Since it was only a few dollars, I decided I'd let it go, and left Macy's.  

I returned to Sephora a few days later to restock on Clinique colors that I love.  I always buy three or more of these at a time to eventually replace the almost-new ones I have already, since the bases fall prey to Arizona's heat and break off.  (I don't have the patience, nor the time, to save these broken pieces in pots and apply them on w/ lipstick brushes.  I wish I did, for I would then have the extra cash to spend on my other hobbies of dining out and watching movies at Camelview!)  Anyhoo, I ended up buying five colors, which amounted to around $77, including tax (three for me, and two to gift Mom w/, because I like her).

See Macy's?  If you didn't make me feel like I was a marked crook by sending your guard, who was ready to jump me at the slightest move, I'd have spent so much more money splurging on my favorite makeup items at your counters, rather than at other stores.  I'm not even pondering on how the rep mislead me by quoting the wrong price-- OK I will... How could she do that when I specifically gave her the product's line and color to look up?  Nevermind.  I'm making it a point to boycott this particular location.  Should I ever want to buy anything from a Macy's, I'll either go to the one in Chandler, or to another state even!  Perhaps I'll just spend my money at Dillard's and Sephora.",7,"AZ","Scottsdale",188,12,22,0.117021276595745,0.0638297872340425

My mom bought me these diamond hoop earrings for Xmas and I took them to exchange for a pair of diamond earrings. The sales lady was nice (kinda pressured me..but in a nice way..she dealt with all my going back and forth). Ultimately, I opted for some diamond earrings that were on clearance (they were still $400 so it's not like I'm not droppin bills). The lady convinces me to buy the extended warranty specifically saying that it covers my earrings being converted into screwbacks - a necessity for earrings. So I finally said okay. I told her I'd bring them back to get them done since I wanted to wear them on New Years and my bday. 

So I take them in last week and the ladies working the counter were nice enough to help me out. I'm pretty sure she even confirmed that my earrings would be taken care of FREE of charge since I already purchased the extended warranty. 

Fast forward to today. Joyce calls me (I'm not sure if she's the one who took my earrings when I came in to get them serviced) to tell me she has an estimate. What?  Estimate for what? My earrings?!?!?! Well apparently Macys will only cover the screwbacks if the earrings are over $1,500. Why the F didn't anyone tell me that before? So no. I don't want to pay $130 for my earrings to be serviced. I'm sure I can find somewhere far less expensive to get them done. Oh wait, so now I'm not going to have my earrings back for another week. FUCKING A. I'm beyond irritated.

You see, back in the day we had so many choices among the big department stores: Goldwater's, I. Magnin, Marshall Field's, Filenes, Bullock's, Bon Marché, Abraham & Straus, and John Wanamaker's. These are some great names, who are now all gone, replaced by a super store called Macy's.

At Fashion Square, we have Dillard's, Nordstrom's, and Needless Markup (er, Neiman Marcus).  They are the best of the remaining big box retail anchors.

Macy's to it's credit, has the size to squeeze suppliers, offering some good value to consumers. But Macy's is a shell of it's former self.  Thanks to the bankruptcy in the early 90's, it began a consolidation phase into one brand.  It also brought about a bland  homogeneous sameness.  

I miss the old brands and the former Macy's. But the new one has some good prices and occasionally a great sale.  So, if do don't mind the same old same old, then this is your place.

Great store; for some reason this particular store was full of ignorant people that had no idea what they were talking about. I bought a very nice $100 dress shirt and a $50 gift card, they were in a Macy's bag, I turned around a couple of times looking at things and next thing I know my bag was gone. I realize this was partially my fault for not watching it more carefully. My fiancé and I asked around - maybe it was in the lost and found? 2 people didn't even know they had a lost and found, 2 more ladies called down there and they said they would call back. After 30 minutes of waiting for them to call back, a lady took us to security who told us to go to lost and found. We went to lost and found and they took us to another lady and told them to call down. After being there for an hour and fifteen minutes a man came up and said, ""if they haven't called back by now, we probably don't have it."" Probably? Well you could've told us that before we wasted an hour of our lives. We left empty handed, and won't shop at that store again.",0,"NV","Las Vegas",59,6,9,0.152542372881356,0.101694915254237

Macy's is currently under renovation to make way for a separate department division right across, entirely for men. Sections have been closed off to spread out whatever's left of women's lines so expect the second floor to be occupied with women's clothing as well (plus teenagers and children) 

This is always a must-stop around Memorial Day, post-Christmas, Thanksgiving and any important holiday really. Why? Clearance. Yes, 65% off original prices and 30% off already reduced prices. Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren price tags go down as low as $14 a shirt - not bad for high quality clothing. 

Clearance shoe racks are arranged according to size and prices range from $10-$80-ish (mind you, these are designer brands) Only downside is if you're a size 6 and find a great pair at size 9, chances are the store won't have stock for your size left. Still, I would trade designer brands any day (not like I'm really into them in the first place) for affordable prices and you can't go wrong with that.",1,"NV","Las Vegas",76,4,10,0.131578947368421,0.0526315789473684

of 5 times to fix my order. The representative spelled my name wrong as 
well as put the wrong zip code on the package.
1. Ordered a second pair for my friend in Houston and they also put the 
wrong address
2. I had to keep calling UPS and Macy's to fix it
3. My package is lost somewhere in sparks, NV and UPS said I have to 
call Macy's and Vice Versa

4. The 4th time I called I asked to speak to a manager they said they 
are busy and it's going to take up to 24 hours (that was on Monday) I'm 
still waiting on that call
5. I called Wednesday and asked them why hasn't anyone called me or even offered to ship me a new pair of shoes? The rep said, I'll send you a new pair they should be there by the 22nd. I will send you a confirmation email. Here it is Friday and I have no shoes and no confirmation email.

I don't understand what is going on and why customer service is so nonchalant and not being proactive about my order. Granted my shoes literally cost $22 but on principal I spend a lot more money shopping as. I feel like I'm not valued as a customer and that they couldn't care less about if or when I get my shoes. My friend got hers 2 days ago and I ordered mine 3 days before her. It makes me wonder if I spend more money would it be handled so 
carelessly.

I have shopped at many Macy's Department stores in various cities.
I find this store to be my favorite.
The manage Rhonda Lawrence is a terrific manager and her employees as well
as customers love her.  The Sales personnel are wonderful, especially
Rayna Morris in housewares.  I am a senior and always looking for ways to save money.  Rayna has helped me with sales coupons on many of my purchases .
Also Pauline in the Women's ware department.  They both know me by name

I witnessed atrocities from the patrons to the workers while browsing the racks and shelves within the store, seriously amazed with the tact and the ability to let it roll off their backs attitude.  I went out of my way to approach a couple of employees who were treated beyond badly by the customers they were helping and who also shrugged it off.  (I would have thrown something at them myself)  They took it in stride, so the customers I think is my only qualm in this mall.

The staff at the jewelry area were unprofessional. I went to Macy's straight from work one evening around the holidays, and was therefore dressed up like somebody with more money to spend than I actually have. I was obviously aimlessly browsing, but the service person fawned over me and stretched to compliment every single bauble I laid my eyes on. Meanwhile, a woman of color couldn't get any attention whatsoever from the clerk. The clerk could easily see she was there, and could definitely hear her. She was actively ignoring the woman who just wanted to be rung up.

Later, I ended up purchasing a couple items of costume jewelry from a different clerk who was very judgey. The thick stank of ""look at this cheap bastard who is wasting all our time just buying costume jewelry"" hung in the air.

Their selection of fine jewelry was decent for a department store. Obviously there are better places to buy fine jewelry. Their selection of costume jewelry and medium-priced stuff was more extensive; Macy's punches its weight in this dept. They also had a good selection of moderately priced men's watches that looked more expensive than they were.

Pros: A pretty large store. I like the selection of jewelry.

Neutral: Clothing selection is just OK. 

Cons: I used to shop at Macy's quite a bit.  Now I have a hard time finding anything that I am excited about purchasing. My biggest frustration with this visit dealt with my trying to get in on the doorbuster deals. Something was going on with the people in front of me. They were taking FOREVER. Like over 10 minutes. But instead of pulling someone in to help with others that would be quick purchases, the cashier alone was focused on this couple. Meanwhile, the doorbuster deadline expired and I couldn't get the price.  Other stores have honored people if they are in line before the doorbuster time ends. Bergner's keeps those prices in their system a bit after the deadline. So...what did I do? Walked out with nothing. They lost a purchase cause they didn't want to give the lower price.

Wow there are some terrible reviews here, but when you look at the surrounding competition this is not that bad. Sure the store is a lot smaller than other macy's sure the selection is not as trendy as other locations, but there are still great sales to be found at this location. I am surprised that this location is two stores which even includes a small furniture selection which is very limited. The only upside is at least there is a macy considering there are not really any other big department stores except for bergner in this mall. The one downside is as other people indicated store staff is super super slow. It took close to 10 minutes to check out with only 1 person in line ahead of us. This is rather disappointing, but what can you do. 

Pros: some macy discount items are heavily discounted at the end of season

Cons: super slow staff, small inventory

Hidden deals:
1. Sign up for a macy's card to get the mailer with coupons.
2. Look in the sunday paper for wow pass

I love Macy's. I'm a black card member and have actually posted that on FB. Cry, girlfriends, cry. I spend more time here than I do on my relationships, my job or my animals (what???). I love it, I don't care.

Went in looking for new bedding. Had a gift card to spend and there were specials. Can't imagine what you'd think I'd do. 

Walked in and met Linda. Who is this fabulous person? She persuaded me with her Macy's charm to walk out with $900 worth of merchandise (after gift card and discounts - $400). I did it so happily that I wonder if I've lost my mind. Until I wake up on 600 thread count Hotel Collection sheets with a duvet and pillows that make my room look like a million bucks. Then I bow to mecca AKA Macy's and Linda, of course.

I love how organized everything is and if you are uncertain about a certain price on an item you can find one of those ""price checker"" and it will tell you the correct price for the item.

They had a variety of items such as: household goods, decorations, bed, furniture, kitchen items, godiva chocolate, perfume, socks, belts, clothes, shoes, make-up, and basically anything you can look for you can find it at Macys. It is a great place to find a gift for yourself of for that special someone.  

However, the customer service in this Macy's  are a hit or miss. Especially, during the holiday/christmas season, the employees are ALWAYS a miss.  I know that usually this time of year it gets crazy for everyone and things get to become very hectic.  The employees starts to feel the pressure and gets  frustrated with everything and everyone.   

During the past times I have visited here this month for christmas shopping, the employees would sarcastically talk to us and would even talk back at us.  I was shocked, I would let it go since it was Christmas time and I had to understand that they were tired and/or cranky but they had no right to speak that way to me. And since coming back from a third world country, I learned to be completely patience with a lot of things. 

Just a week ago, my mother and I were at the women's shoe department and wow that place was a HOT MESS. Shoes, boxes, wrapping, and trash were all over the floor and it seemed like they were short staffed.  Anyways, we waited at the register where there was a line of customers, but there was no cashier there.  One of the employees saw us waiting in line but she didnt even acknowledge us at all or even told us that register was close.  All the customers waited there for about 10mins or so until my mom finally asked the employee if someone was going to help us.  She said. ""Oh, that registered is close."" Wow.

I have been shopping at Macy's for many years. Between Black Friday deals, credit card holder specials, and holiday sales, there is usually a discount to be found, SOMEWHERE if you look. For instance, the THANKS FOR SHARING program. Basically, if you have a Macy's cc account, you get 10% of your purchases back on a gift card. I got $70.00 last year, and I look forward to February to see what I get this year.

Natalia in furniture assisted us and she was so very helpful and pleasant to work with. Purchasing a sofa is not a quick decision-making process. Natalia was very patient with us, and we felt she truly had our best interests at heart. She took the time to clearly explain the process and what to expect next.

The store itself is older, and I took off one star because it really needs a makeover/overhaul. 

We were very pleased, as always, with the Macy's store policies on shipping, cancelling orders, etc. We loved that the funds are not actually taken from our account until the furniture is actually available and being shipped. We understand the sofa should take about 8 weeks to arrive to us. Because of the quality of the furniture, the service from Natalia, and the store's ethical policies, we feel it is best to be patient and have the confidence our order is truly being taken care of and that Macy's will stand behind their promises. 

Natalia also pointed out that perhaps in the next 8 weeks the price might drop - she will check for this and adjust the price for us - so we will always lock in the lowest sale price. What a generous policy!

Natalia even walked outside with swatches and a sofa pillow, so that we could see the color in natural sunlight. She really went above and beyond.

If you're looking for a safe, quality furniture-buying experience, please try this Macy's home store. You can also call and ask for Natalia. She has ten years of furniture experience.

This store has always attracted me for some reason.....maybe because it seems like a piece of history or something. There aren't too many upscale department stores left in mid-town Phoenix anymore. In fact none that I can even think of. It's great not having to drive out to the 'burbs somewhere to go shopping at a nice department store. I'm glad this store has survived.

Like I said, I went shopping late Friday night so there weren't a whole lot of people in the store so it was VERY relaxing to shop and browse. 

I decided to get a Macy's credit card and approached a service desk. Literally within 2 minutes I had an account and was ready to go. I know it's the age of technology but getting a credit account at 9:15 on a Friday night in two minutes is pretty cool.

Did some more shopping....I mean I had a 20% discount now with the new credit card (discount good for two days once you've opened an account). Got some pretty good deals on the clearance racks.

And yes, it's pricey...but it's Macy's. Who doesn't expect to pay more at a department store? TJ Maxx and Marshalls are great options to find discounted clothing....but some of the deals on the Macy's clearance racks were just as good.

There were several reviews of this location criticizing the slow service. Didn't get that at all. Granted they weren't busy but the staff was all exceptionally nice and pleasant. Someone was always asking if I needed help, and yes, that can sometimes get annoying but they did it in such a pleasant manner that it wasn't bothersome. They were just trying to do their job. 

One employee was exceptionally nice. He saw that I had just opened a new credit account and went out of his way to welcome me to the Macy's 'family.' It's stuff like that makes paying  extra sometimes worth it.

Yes, you have to give them props for longevity, the parade in NYC, Miracle on 34th St.....etc....but companies simply cannot rest on their laurels and assume that bad service is ever OK.  Which leads me to why I'm reviewing this location and giving 2 stars.

When me mums was out for Thanksgiving a few weeks ago we went there because she wanted to look at some things for Xmas gifts.  I drove her there and went along for the ride. While we were in the jewelry section she commented on a few items she liked and I made mental notes to come back and stock up for Xmas for her (after she'd left town).  When I went back I was astounded by the rudeness of the employees/disinterest in actually helping customers.

After several searching for a sales associate in the jewelry area for about 5 minutes with no one in sight, finally a middle aged white lady appeared in the fine jewelry section. She sort of hid behind a display and when I finally made eye contact with her she seemed completely put off by the fact that I had a question about jewelry.  I told & showed her what I was looking for, but in a different size and when she asked if I was looking for gold and I explained no, silver...she rolled her eyes and wafted me away with her hand back towards the ""cheap"" jewelry. 

Fortunately for me (and Macy's) a lovely lady named Shell appeared and rushed over to help me, (despite the fact that I was ""only"" looking at $100 necklaces in silver).    She was super helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about her inventory, made some recommendations and showed me several pieces.  I ended up getting the $100 necklace AND a pair of earrings from her and she was more than happy to help me, ring me up with me a smile and at least redeem Macy's momentarily.  Shell rocks and should be promoted.  The other lady should get the stick outta her choochoo and stop pretending she works at Tiffany's.

On the way out I passed mens fragrance and inquired about some product for my roomie.  The snotty little fashionista twink sales associate scoffed at my inquiry and and rolled his eyes and I thought I better get outta Macy's before my Shell-induced glow waned any further.

All said, I got what I came for and have arranged some nice Xmas gifts for mom, but my overall experiences at Macy's mainly serve to solidify why I abhor the mall, large retail chains and would prefer to shop local indie.",5,"AZ","Phoenix",167,9,25,0.149700598802395,0.0538922155688623

Andy swooped in and helped us find two great Calvin Klein suits on sale for under $200! The material was beautiful and the cut of the suit was perfect.

If you can swing by the location at Fashion Square, I would suggest them over this one any day.  My experiences only extend to the fine jewelry, watches, makeup, handbag, shoes, petites, and home departments, but I have heard some positive things about the men's section.

The primary issue for me tends to be the customer service... or usually, unfortunately, the lack there of.  Even when there aren't many customers around, the salespeople tend to be very snippy and hasty with any questions I have had.  Waiting in line to purchase my items, I would like to be recognized but tend to feel as though I am inconveniencing them by merely being in line.  As a regular shopper on the whole, it leaves a rather negative taste in my mouth and instead of my usual perusing, I find myself trying to get in and out of there as fast as possible.

I think housewares is probably the weakest section of the store I have encountered due to the fact that the only way to find someone to assist you is to go to the registry area because there are never any associates anywhere other than there as well as the children's department.  Even help with purchasing items for a registry was a pain and I ended up going for a drive to Fashion Square to complete it.  Granted, it isn't the sales department's fault that their selection is so tiny, I was looking for someone to even offer to check or call another store for me and that service was not extended even after asking for it.

I never used to be a department store shopper, but recently Ive discovered that nicer cloths just seem to fit better. Go figure.

The staff has been hit or miss, but selection has always been decent.  That is... until today.

I had some time to spare after an afternoon meeting nearby, so I decided to stop by and check out their latest sale.  I was in the market for both myself and my almost one year old son.  I stopped by the shoe section first and was disappointed to see that many of the brands that they used to carry were no longer there.  I was not impressed with the shoe selection at all.  So, on to clothes.  I did find a couple of shirts that I liked: Free People and Splendid specifically (and bonus - there's a decent sale going on, but you do have to go through racks of stuff to find the gems).  But they no longer carry Trina Turk and the quality of what they do carry seemed much cheaper than I remembered.  I also asked a couple of sales people for help and they were not friendly at all.  From there, I went up to the third level to check out the kids' department.  Selection was not good there either; at least for boys.  They had a few cute Carter's pajamas sets and some Ralph Lauren stuff, but nothing amazing that I had to buy.

So, for a department store, Macy's is A-OK, but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  I much prefer Nordstrom's now for my department store shopping!  

PS - I'm by no means a shopping snob, so I hope the above doesn't come off that way.  I don't shop that often, so when I do, I appreciate friendly and helpful staff, and of course cute stuff to choose from!",7,"AZ","Phoenix",98,3,18,0.183673469387755,0.0306122448979592

I stopped here to see if they had the Emporio Armani watch that I liked and had seen in Fashion Square.  They sure did and I was glad I stopped.  Luxury watch fanatics take note. The friends and family discount is the only one that can be used for certain watches, including Emporio.  The sales assistant was wonderful and even sold me on the extended service plan.  The plan even includes lifetime battery replacement.  I have about 5 armanis and when the watch batteries die, its at least 20-50 smackers per pop.  The $19.99 service agreement was a deal!  I hardly ever buy them.  To top off this wonderful service sundae, she even removed the links on the watch.  This was something they did not do in the past.  Lastly, she asked me to send my friends her way.  I loved that.  Not many businesses ask you to refer them to your friends for additional business.

So this location has appealed to me in that it's kind of a stand-alone entity. You don't have to walk through a bunch of stuff to get to it. The parking (depending on when you go) has on many occasions offered me rock star quality spots so that alone gives them an extra star in my book. 

But yesterday, the unthinkable, the unimaginable happened. 

As you may have noticed, due to the 110+ temps going on right now, we are fully planted in swimsuit season. I, call me weird if you want, am not a fan of shopping for swimsuits. I feel that every dessert, every chip, every carb you've ever eaten comes to haunt you during swimsuit season. 

I marched into Macy's (having another one of their screaming deal sales), grabbed 5 swimsuits (mentally prepared to leave the dressing room in tears) and lo and behold, I fell in love with two of them. TWO SWIMSUITS IN ONE DAY! Did you hear that?!? That was the sound of my ample tookus falling on the floor in shock. That sort of miracle only happens for the fit-bodied or the blessed people who don't care what they look like in a swimsuit. Not for the people like me. The people who know what it's like to be continuously self-conscious, when-did-I-get-backfat, I'm pretty sure that isn't supposed to jiggle, why can't I wear a wetsuit instead so I can cover this flubber...Macy's pulled off a miracle yesterday. I left there feeling pretty damned sexy. That's worth 2 more stars. 

The final star is for the super sales they have for me whenever I show up. If you want a discount, all you have to do is ask. If you're from out of town, tell the cashier and they usually have a discount for that too. Or maybe that star is for the great shoe selection. It's not my favorite shoe store, but it's definitely my favorite in my neighborhood.",3,"AZ","Phoenix",123,13,23,0.186991869918699,0.105691056910569

I was in need of a very specific item, a black chunky belt to go with a specific outfit. First off I could not find an associate to ask were I could find accessories let alone a black belt.

I eventually figured that the belts would probably be somewhere around the jewelry or the purses so I made my way over to the jewelry department. Eventually I found the belts in a very small corner by the purses. The organization was horrible and I probably should have just looked elsewhere but I was running out of time and I just need this particular item. So I started looking through the belts and low and behold I found a gem on clearance. This is where the real issue began.

I made my way over to the nearest counter that I found and no one was around. I went to look around the accessory department to see if I could locate an associate. No one to be found. I saw one associate assisting a customer with a purse but I did not want to bug her in the middle of a sale. I figured I would just head to a nearby jewelry counter to make my purchase. I noticed an associate at the Fossil watch counter and I approached her. I asked if I could purchase the belt at her counter and she very rudely tells me that she is with another customer and she will be with me in a minute and that I should just stay put. I did not mind that she was with another customer, I fully understand that but it was the tone in which she said it that was very off putting. Also with so many other counters open at Macy's I did not understand why she could not have suggested that I maybe go to another counter.

I did decide that I did not want to deal with that attitude and took my purchase to another counter. This associate saved the purchase for me. She was very friendly, approachable and lovely. She even scanned an additional percent coupon for me that she did not even have to do. So bottom line here that I learned is that there are certain people at this location of Macy's who do not make a judgment on the purchase you are making who are more than willing to help you and also those who hate their job and cannot wait until you leave. Your experience will vary depending on which associate you are assisted by.",4,"AZ","Chandler",133,12,22,0.165413533834586,0.0902255639097744

One time, after I finished shopping and about to leave the store the alarm went off. I stood around and no one came to check the security for me. The girls at the cosmetic department were just hanging around. I had my 2 year old sitting in a $20 stroller with Macys shopping bags on one handle, and the other handle has my open tote w/ no zipper. No one is approaching, so I had to do it myself, $260 worth of cheap clothes so there were 12-15 items, I forgot. After I checked and made sure no security tags I proceed to leave the store. As I was leaving an associate came and stopped me and wanted to check my bags. I told her I checked already and I'm ok. She insisted on going through my bags just to make sure. I told her I have to go pick up my daughter as it was approaching 2:30. She said that it's policy and insinuated that I have unpaid items. I got frustrated because I stood around and had to do the security work myself and no one helped for like 2-3 minutes and now this?? I was so mad I told her to take everything back bc I have to leave. This associate knew I was in a hurry and dragged the procedure. I used to work for department stores and I'm positively sure that when the alarm goes off, all associates are to be alerted and proceed to the help with shoppers' bags. After the incidence, I called the store and explained the whole situation. I'm pretty sure they reviewed the cameras and sent me two $25 gift certificate.

After working countless Black Friday's myself, if anyone is sympathetic to associates and the perspective of the employees, it would be me. 

But, nothing excuses the fact that there is clearly lack of talent available on the sales floor for YES, one of the highest traffic days your store will see all year. Or the fact that the store is so obviously terribly understaffed, or horribly scheduled, that the trash in every part of the store is overflowing with cups and food items- SO disgusting. There was no recovery going on. Thanks, the evening shopper definitely was not treated and welcomed into the store the way I'm sure they welcomed their 6pm shopper on Thanksgiving Day. Perhaps that is what happens to profit-hungry, lack-of-connecting with-customer companies when they put their own ideas of success before their employees needs. It was utterly a disaster and you don't even have to work in retail to see that was the case.

I walked in, fully prepared and willing to deal with any lines, tired associates, etc. I had done my research ahead of time, no dilly-dallying, in and out, they can have the commission, I get my couch, done deal. Walking in being greeted by that messy and trash-infested disaster should have been my first cue. Walking thru the home appliances and home goods area was a nightmare in progress......you don't have open boxes of knives on the level where kids can reach- seriously. SMH. I waited in the furniture area for 20 minutes before I finally went up to the one associate and asked for help. She was in the corner, working with one couple while at least 15 other people milled around. Lack of coverage, lack of sales, lack of profit- great equation Macy's. 

Yep, I walked in, and walked out- no sale. At least the parking lot wasn't full (natch). Not even gonna try another store- online with this Brand forever. Peace out, you just lost dollars and I'm sure I'm not the only one.",0,"AZ","Chandler",143,17,29,0.202797202797203,0.118881118881119

I was in the store shopping for my husband and nephew. In one hand I had bags from purchases made at other stores, and in my other arm I was juggling my purse, a fountain drink, and a shirt I was planning to purchase in-store.  I didn't have a free hand to shop, so I approached a young sales rep at a register in the men's department and politely asked her if I could have a paper shopping bag (the one with handles) so I could merge my stuff into one bag and free up a hand to shop.  She hesitated while looking me up and down and then informed me that I would have to make a purchase before I could have a bag.  I was irritated that Macy's couldn't spare a .20 cent bag to ease my Christmas shopping experience but I was even more incensed at the way the sales rep looked at me, as though I was going to try to stuff something in the bag I hadn't paid for.  Obviously, with a Dillards bag and a Disney store bag in hand I was making purchases that day.   I put the shirt back on the rack that I was planning to buy and left the store and finished my shopping for the boys at Dillards and Dicks.

I am a business professional and I work in sales.  The entire sales team in our company just finished reading ""The Customer Rules"" by Lee Cockerell.  I recommend Macy's invest in a similar plan for their sales team.  They need to learn how to create a welcome environment for their customers and go above & beyond to provide exemplary service.

I'll shop here on Black Friday but never really any other time of the year.",0,"PA","Pittsburgh",28,6,4,0.142857142857143,0.214285714285714

I am still giving the store a 4 out of 5 because it is much better than most mall Macy's.  It has a very nice sized men's department and special touches that you don't find in the malls like restaurants (Tic Tok is a nice lunch spot) and a bakery (always make sure to get a thumb print cookie at the arcade bakery!",1,"PA","Pittsburgh",27,0,4,0.148148148148148,0

With a singular purpose, I came to this store to buy socks.  Because the store sits on a hill, there are all these different levels....various floors and mezzanines abound and it gives the store a weird kind of flow.

I found the socks I needed (Under Armour sport socks, low cut, in black and in white) and the guy who checked me out was helpful.  The store was clean and organized.

I can't complain about this store at all.  I mean, I could, but it wouldn't be genuine and if you know anything about me, it's that I keep things real.",2,"PA","Pittsburgh",63,3,15,0.238095238095238,0.0476190476190476

Being a Black, female who appears as someone in their early 20s and is normally wearing converse shoes and a ratty Jansport backpack it can be a challenge to discern on which level you are being discriminated against. 

I am in no way exaggerating my treatment here at this Macy.  I have literally walked up to an employee who looks at me and then walks away from the service counter.  I have waited patiently at a service counter for over ten minutes while people who are approached after me get service . 

You may ask, hey why not just speak up and say, "" I was waiting here can you please help me?"" No matter how politely you ask that question the color of my skin will surely convey it as a hostile statement. 

I WILL NO LONGER BE SPENDING ANOTHER DAMN DOLLAR OF MY HARD EARNED MONEY HERE.  My boyfriend always gets me a Macy's gift card for special occasions but I have put an end to that this year. 

Macy employees have also disrespected my mother and my sister. They asked a clerk about a particular garment they were interested in to which he replied, ""Oh that's too pricey.""

The racism that persist in retail stores is so annoying, Macy's you've made my shitlist. 

p.s The Arcade Bakery also burned my tuna melt lol.",7,"PA","Pittsburgh",95,8,11,0.115789473684211,0.0842105263157895

Growing up, I lived about 45 minutes away from the city. Every black friday, my aunt would pick me up and we'd go to Macys for some black friday shopping. We'd park over at station square, walk the bridge, check out some downtown decorations and head into Macys (excuse me... it was Kauffman's back then) Great memories, especially from a kid who felt stuck in the suburbs her entire childhood.

Most things are pretty easy to find. The most annoying thing to find however is the young men's clothing. I can't even explain how you get to it once inside the Macys. Luckily, it has an entrance from the outside on Fifth Avenue.. a little down from the bakery.",0,"PA","Pittsburgh",58,3,9,0.155172413793103,0.0517241379310345

Shopping at one of the malls makes me feel like I am just shopping for items by myself and not given much help. Still, they do offer coupon specials such as friends and family where you can get 25% off most everything at certain times of the year.

They have a nice selection of merchandise. Unfortunately it is difficult to find something in my size.

This year I went to the downtown store to see the holiday window and to my disappointment all but one were the same windows they used last year. It is the only department store in my city but at least they could be creative to come up with a new theme like they do in other cities.

Still I will shop it now and again. I hate to order online because they normally won't offer you free shipping unless you make a $99.00 purchase. Sometimes that works for me and I can find something worthwhile. Other times it doesn't.

It all depends what you are looking for. They just don't seem to be what they were in the past.",1,"PA","Pittsburgh",55,3,7,0.127272727272727,0.0545454545454545
